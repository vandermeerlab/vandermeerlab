% for Tmaze data

% ABOUT
% This script loads metadata and ExpKeys and collects behavioural data into
% a struct that can be loaded for further analyses later, such as plotting 
% or chi square tests. The behav struct has the following organization:

%  behav.R042.food.L = mean nLeft trials on food day
%  behav.R042.food.R = mean nRight trials on food day
%  behav.R042.food.pLtrl = probably of going L on a food day across trials
%  behav.R042.water.L =  ...
%  . . .
%  behav.R042.water.pRtrl =  ^^      ^^      R on a water day    ^^   
%  behav.R044.food.L =  ...
%  . . .
%  and so on

% (food) and (water) refer to the restriction type, and (L) and (R) refer to the
% arms on the Tmaze.
% pLtrl fields, for example, contain the probability that the rat chose, L 
% (food reward) on a food restriction day for each trial.
% Note that "bad" and forced trials (as specified in the ExpKeys) are removed, 
% so not every 11th trial is the "real" 11th trial in terms of actual number of
% track traversals. These should probably be replaced with NaNs instead, but
% was done this way to preserve the original handling of the data in the cosyne 
% scripts. Some sessions have zero bad trials, and some sessions have two or 
% more. (A bad trial means the rat attempted to reverse directions and needed 
% to be interferred with by the researcher). Forced trials are quite
% common, and these are trials where the favoured arm was blocked and the
% rat had no choice but to go down the unfavoured arm.

% aacarey Sept 2015, based on thesis script which in turn was based on MvdM
